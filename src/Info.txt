Three steps in routing:
 Step 1: Wrap your very first component or major component(i.e App) in the component tree in a 
 {BrowserRouter}component.
 This  {BrowserRouter} comes under react router dom.
 whatever you write it should be insdie {BrowserRouter}.
 for ex.<BrowserRouter>
        <App/>
        <BrowserRouter/>   => gives all the functionality of routing.

 Step 2: Define {Route} for our component,we can use this {Route}  to display info depending on the 
 URL on the URL bar.
if someone is writing www. -----.com/ .... => then route this component

Step 3 : Control the URL with the {NavLink , Link} component.

 we need to provide path and component on which you want to render ..in route
/ means nothing only website
after deletion particular component that also shown on website

All routes are in one file and that is also in parent file

/ it will always render home and then particular component=> it checks all the routes

for redirect we have redirect in router dom
when we use redirect form / to /home then after writing /about it is still redirecting on home 
because it checks all route it matches that runs and again it comes to redirect where it go to home

exaxt in route will only work with that route .with same thing
whatever redirect running at end will run that.
****Solution to this is Switch as soon as it matches with one route it will not go n check 
for others.
** if nothing matches then redirect to error page
if you dont give from then nothing will match go on this page


11 May:
<a> tag ...when we click on something browser is making request to server.
Server will send that particular file to you.
If the file is large it will take time to get loaded on your browser.
Solution: Use NavLink or Link
It will not make another request for same file.
It will take from the same file which is already there will not make new request like <a>.


Diffrence between NavLink and Link :
NavLink ==>comes with default class :active class but we have to give css in this class .
whenever we click that active class get applied over there.
Link ==>>doesnt comes up with default class

part of url will same for everyone ...some part is unique for everyone

filter stores in array

data.find will iterate through data.json and it will check for condition and if condition matchesit will
it will not check for others.It will not check another item.
But filter iterates through all the items whichever matches it will put that into array.
